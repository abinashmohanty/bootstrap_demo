#A Responsive Demo Page based on Bootstrap Framework
As a UX designer, one should know how to convert your design into working prototype for presentation purpose. 


This is a demo page that is based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
Feel free to download or make appropriate contributions to this page. 

### Dummy copy on "What’s SH*T Framework?"

Framework like SH*T is our new innovation, and we spent less than an hour to marked up the front-end design by using the popular Bootstraap Framework. That’s the real truth behind SH*T Framework. If you know how to use Bootstrap, you can come up with almost any web page just like this demo page called the SH*T Framework.  So it’s not a Framework rather than a demo page based on Bootstrap 3.2.2; just to create rapid prototypes less than an hour. 


###Dummy copy on "Difficult to learn SH*T?"

It’s difficult to learn SH*T but not the Bootstrap Framework. We specially converted the front-end in such a way so that they can’t learn SH*T, but we can help them download the Bootstrap Framework link that is located under the footer section bellow. So don’t even think of trying SH*T Framework. For instance, the below Read More button doesn’t open up a read me page because you’re already reading us.

###Dummy copy on "Why we launched SH*T?"

There was this little story. And being a story-teller I love to come up with something different rather than putting those boring lorem ipsum text. You should have something fun to read after all. This is not a SH*T Framework rather than Bootstrap Version 3.2.2. I’m a ux designer, and I love to try out different front-end design tools & techniques. And this is how you can create a simple working prototype within an hour.  


###My next project?

My next project is to develop a user interface style guide that can help both design & front-end team to understand how each style works throughout the pages. Here are some of the key features I'm gonna include in this UI style guide project via Github & Github Pages. 

* Live examples of UI elements
* See markups used for each UI element
* Specifications for all color & typography used in this project.
* And more to come...
