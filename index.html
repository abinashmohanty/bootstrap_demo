        <h3>What’s SH*T Framework?</h3>
        <p>Framework like SH*T is our new innovation, and we spent less than an hour to marked up the front-end design by using the popular Bootstraap Framework. That’s the real truth behind SH*T Framework. If you know how to use Bootstrap, you can come up with almost any web page just like this demo page called the SH*T Framework.  Well, this is based on <strong>Bootstrap 3.2.2</strong>; just to create rapid prototypes less than an hour. </p>

        <h3>Difficult to learn SH*T?</h3>
        <p>It’s difficult to learn SH*T but not the <strong>Bootstrap 3.2.2</strong> Framework. We specially converted the front-end in such a way so that they can’t learn SH*T, but we can help them download the Bootstrap Framework link that is located under the footer section bellow. So don’t even think of trying SH*T Framework. For instance, the below Read More button doesn’t open up a read me page because you’re already reading us.</p>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Read More</button>

        <h3>Why we launched SH*T?</h3>
        <p>There was this little story. And being a story-teller I love to come up with something different rather than putting those boring <em>lorem ipsum</em> text. You should have something fun to read after all. This is not a SH*T Framework rather than <strong>Bootstrap 3.2.2</strong>. I’m a ux designer, and I love to try out different front-end design tools and techniques. And this is how you can create a simple working prototype within an hour.</p>
